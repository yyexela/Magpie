# Activity 4
## Exploration
#### How does it respond to:
"I want to build a robot." - User
"What would it mean to build a robot?" - Magpie

"I want to understand French." - User
"What would it mean to understand French?" - Magpie

"Do you like me?" - User
"What makes you think that I like you?" - Magpie

"You confuse me." - User
"What makes you think that I confuse you?" - Magpie

#### Example where the transform statements don't work:
Saying "you are not me" yields "What makes you think that I are not you?"  
There are gramatical errors. This can be fixed by checking if "are" in the statement exists and then switching it to "am".
