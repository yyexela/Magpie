# Activity 2
## Start
"My mother and I talked last night" - User  
"Tell me more about your family." - bot  

"I said no!" - User  
"Why so negative?" - bot  

"The weather is nice" - User  
"Interesting, tell me more." - bot  

"Do you know my brother?" - User  
"Why so negative?" - bot  

#### Extra keywords:
"alexey"
"Hey! THATS YOUUUU"

"snow"
"MMmmmm, reminds me of snowcones"

"alcohol"
"Drinking and driving is bad mmkay"

#### Extra random responses:
"Wow!"
"That's boring lol."

#### Prioritizing responses
Having "my brother and a cat" responds with the "brother" text because it comes first in the list of if statements. To prioritize pets over family you would need to have the pet if-statement come first.

## Questions
1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider the statments like "I know all state capitals" and "I like vegetables smothered in cheese." Explain the problem with the responses to these statements.

The first statments has the string "no" in "know", triggering the response "Why so negative?".

The seconds statement has the string "mother" in "smothered" triggering the response "Tell me more about your family."
